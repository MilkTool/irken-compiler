    <h1>Irken</h1>

<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>
 A new dialect and implementation of a python-like language that
  supports massively scalable cooperative multi-threading, and
  eventually, erlang-style concurrency.</p>

<h2>How</h2>
 <p>A VM that supports continuations. 'threads' will be built using
 continuations.  The VM will be written in a new high-level language
 'Irken' that compiles to C.  Continuations will be available in
 both the target language and the implementation language, and since
 we want to support millions of threads, we cannot use the C stack.
 Our approach is to generate continuation-passing style (CPS) code in
 C.</p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>

<ol>
 <li> Implement the irken compiler.</li>
 <li> Write a VM for the python-like language in Irken.</li>
 <li> Rewrite the irken compiler in the python-like language.</li>
 <li> ?? </li>
 <li> Profit! </li>
</ol>

<p>Currently, I'm in stage 2 - though about 90% of the work is still in stage 1.</p>

<h3>Python-like Language ('PLL')</h3>

<p>
  This should look as much like Python as possible, though it will
start life as a much smaller language.  My current thinking is that it
will be dynamically typed (just like Python), though I may experiment
with some kind of type inference.  PLL will use a VM, implemented in Irken.
<i>Yes, I need a better name than 'PLL'.</i>  Originally, I had planned to call the two languages 'Irken-Low' and 'Irken-High', but this would just be confusing since they have almost nothing in common.  Also, I believe Irken will be useful on its own.
</p>

<h3>Irken</h3>

<p>
  Currently, this is a strange hybrid of Scheme and ML/Haskell -
although it looks like Scheme, it uses ML-style Hindley-Milner
let-polymorphism, with algebraic datatypes.  The lisp syntax was
chosen for reasons of simplicity and flexibility.  Once PLL is
available, I may think about giving Irken a pythonic syntax.  The main
feature missing from the ML/Haskell world is full pattern matching,
though a simpler variant-case syntax works pretty well.
</p>

<p>
  Irken compiles to a single large function in a single C file.
Function calls are implemented as 'gotos' within this function.  A
simple register-machine model is used.
</p>

<p>  I may consider a second backend target to LLVM, although LLVM's thin
support for GC will be useless without a stack.</p>

<h3>Concurrency: Solve Two Problems, Create One.</h3>

<p> Two problems I hope to solve using Erlang-style isolated 'threads':
</p>
<p> First, garbage collection.  If every thread has its own heap, garbage
 collection will be naturally 'concurrent' - i.e., we'll avoid having
 one gigantic collection that sweeps 12GB of memory..
</p>
<p> Second, modules / external code.  The runtime model of Irken
 makes it very difficult to link in new compiled code at run-time.  If
 we instead demand erlang-style isolation, it's not a problem - just
 load up a new 'VM' and run it in a separate process/thread.
</p>
<p> IPC: the price to pay - now we need a very efficient way of
   communicating between process/threads.  But we needed that anyway.
</p>
<h3>Platforms</h3>

<p>  My current testing platforms include FreeBSD/amd64, FreeBSD/i386,
  OSX/G5, both 32 and 64-bit.  Irken should work on any platform
  that supports gcc (or any other C compiler that supports the
  address-of-label extension, which most do...) and some kind of
  rdtsc-like facility - though if you were desperate you could just
  strip out the tsc stuff - it's only used for timings.
</p>

<p> [Note: looks like clang is out - at least on Snow Leopard the address-of-label
  feature is silently broken.  Also seems to not like lexical functions.]

<h3>The Python code</h3>

<dl>
<dt>compile.py</dt>
<dd>drives everything.</ddd>

<dt>lisp_reader.py</dt>
<dd>  reads scheme forms into an s-expression.
  <br>input: program
  <br>output: s-exp
</dd>

<dt>transform.py</dt>
<dd>  converts all derived scheme expressions into the core understood by the compiler.
  <br>input: s-exp
  <br>output: s-exp
</dd>

<dt>nodes.py</dt>
<dd>  convert the s-expression into a tree of nodes.
  <br>input: s-exp
  <br>output: node tree
</dd>

<dt>typing.py</dt>
<dd>  hindley-milner polymorphic type inference [obsolete] </dd>

<dt>solver.py</dt>
<dd>  constraint-based type inference, based on ATTPL Chapter 10 </dd>      

<dt>analyze.py</dt>
<dd>  alpha conversion, tree shaker, inliner, some simplification
  <br>input: node tree

<dt>cps.py</dt>
<dd>  convert to continuation-passing style, where each continuation is represented
    by a 'register' assignment.

<h3>The Scheme/Irken Code</h3>

<h4>lib/*.scm</h4>

<p>  These are considered 'official' library implementations of runtime features.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>core.scm</dt><dd>
    candidates for compiler builtins (i.e., no need to (include "xxx.scm"))</dd>
  <dt>frb.scm</dt><dd>
    functional red-black trees.  may be used for the symbol table, dicts, etc. (based on Okasaki)</dd>
  <dt>io.scm</dt><dd>
    core unix i/o</dd>
  <dt>pair.scm</dt><dd>
    lisp lists</dd>
  <dt>random.scm</dt><dd>
    random(3)</dd>
  <dt>rbtree.scm</dt><dd>
    red-black tree code from scheme48</dd>
  <dt>string.scm</dt><dd>
    string support</dd>
  <dt>symbol</dt><dd>
    lisp/scheme symbols</dd>
  <dt>vector</dt><dd>
    lisp/scheme vectors (i.e., python lists)</dd>
</dl>

<h4>tests/*.scm</h4>
  Currently, these are ad-hoc tests used to verify the compiler features as I
  write them.  Eventually, these will turn into automated tests (like the ones
  in compile.py).

<h4>vm/*.scm</h4>
  will hold the VM for the python-like language.
   
<h3>Quick usage notes.</h3>

<pre>
python compile.py
 - compile and run all the self-tests which you will find near the end of compile.py

python compile.py -l
 - compile and run only the last test

python compile.py -f tests/tak20.scm
 - compile tests/tak20.scm to
           tests/tak20.c and then
           tests/tak20

'-a': include cps insn annotation in generated C code
'-v': verbose compiler output
'-f': compile this file
'-O': optimize (gcc -O3)
