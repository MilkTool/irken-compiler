metadata
--------

We need a way of attaching metadata of various kinds to the program.
It needs to be accessible *by* the program.  Examples include:

    datatypes with tags (for runtime reflection)
    polyvar names and tags (for exception printing)
    function names/address/pc/etc (for debugging)
    ctypes: can we subsume the current ctypes hack into this?

The simplest way to do this is to use a map of s-expressions.  we
could have various functions at the top level grab this data and have
it at the ready.  For example, a vector of symbols would suffice to
name every polyvar.  Then getting the name for an exception would
consist of looking up its tag and indexing into that table.
