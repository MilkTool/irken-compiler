Been around a few times with supporting OO in some fashion.
Clearly HM and OO don't get along too well.
But somewhere between 'records' and 'classes' must be a sweet spot.

(class thing
   (x:int y:int ob)
   (define (meth0 self)
     (+ (* self.x self.x) (* self.y self.y)))
    )

Trying to find a way to represent objects/methods/etc... using
algebraic types...

'self' here should have type int*int*'a (i.e., 'thing')
so 'thing' is an alias for int*int*'a.
'meth0' should have type thing->int

A bound method is like a curried function application?

Ok, let's try to emulate python itself.

First, there's a 'class object', which will be a product
type consisting of the class variables including methods.

So in this case 'thing-class' will be simply #(meth0).
'thing-object' will be of type int*int*'a

In python - an object has to have a pointer to its type/class.
We shouldn't need to do that?  So an object can simply be a tuple of
its slots.  [again, we need to keep in mind here the difference
between objects in irken low and high]

-------------------------------------------

The circular dependency problem.

Figuring out the type of object a 'get' refers to requires running the
type inference engine, which requires sorting into strongly connected
components.  But sorting into strongly connected components requires
knowing which class each object is.

1) one possible solution is to separate this into two passes... since
the SCC graph is only needed in order to support polymorphism, maybe
we can assign classes in a first class that ignores polymorphism, and
finish up with the normal algorithm?

Would this keep us from mixing polymorphism and classes?

2) Can we modify or eliminate the need for the SCC graph?


-------------------------------------------

Closures?  How far can we get by emulating OO with closures?
In Scheme, we use a 'getattr'-like function to return a random
object.  That can't work with static types... but is there some other
way to do it?
