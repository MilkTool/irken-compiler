I'd like to provide some kind of introspection (with respect to types)
at runtime.  Now that I know how to use %%sexp in macros, this might
be easier.

--- aside ---
  | we need a real motivation for this other than xxx-repr,
  | because that could be auto-generated.

I think we need two data structures at runtime:

1) a representation of type.
2) a representation of datatypes.

Yah, it's confusing.

When an expression has type `(tree int string)`, that is #1.
But the definition of a tree is #2.

We will need both to do full introspection at runtime.
A possible goal here is to be able to print out objects
without having to write `xxx-repr` and `xxx-print` funs.

For #1, we need a special form that will generate a literal, just
like with %%ffitype.

For #2, we will need a runtime version of the datatype declaration.
