This is the initial release of the self-hosted compiler.

It's still in a very unpolished state, but you can use it to bootstrap itself.

Here's how.

1) compile self/compile.c with gcc.
  on OSX you'll need to add the '-fnested-functions' arg if you are using the stock gcc

  $ gcc -I. -m64 self/compile.c -o self/compile

2) compile it with itself

  $ self/compile self/compile.scm

3) and again, for fun.

  $ self/compile self/compile.scm

Enjoy.
