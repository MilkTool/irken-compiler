Read-Eval-Print-Loop
--------------------

This isn't actually a REPL for Irken, but rather a demonstration of
how to write a simple scheme interpreter using Irken.

The small amount of code here demonstrates:

  1) lexical environments
  2) function application
  3) primitives

... and can be easily extended to add more functionality.

Fun exercises:

  1) add more list-processing functions
  2) add a socket interface (see the `doom` directory).
